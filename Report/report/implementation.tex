\section{Implementation of a Verifier}

\subsection{Verificatum Mix Network (TODO)}

"Verificatum [...] is an implementation of an El Gamal-based mixnet
... [that] produce a verifiable proof of correctness during the
execution of the protocol" (Abstract i vmnv-1.1.0). It is a
reencryption mixnet.

There is a key distribution phase.

There is a shuffling phase, during which each server provides a proof
of shuffle (Beskriv vad detta är)

\subsection{Specification (TODO)}

The documentation describing the Verificatum Mixnet verifier---.

The document describes a number of subtasks, some of which may be
implemented independently. The subtasks include include implementation
of general representation of data, an arithmetic library needed to
perform group operations, the cryptographic primitives and the
structure of files created during an execution of the
mixnet. Furthermore, all algorithms executed during the verification
are described in detail in order to allow an independent verifier.

%Here follows some suggestions to improve the readability and ---.

\subsection{General Design Choices}

The first implementation choice was which programming language to
use. We wanted to use well established technologies and have a good
performance [REF] on the verifier. Considering these criteria and our
programming skills, the choice was made between C, C++ and Java. Since
other groups are working on implementations in Java we decided to use
C or C++ and since we wanted to use features such as operator
overloading and some OOP, we settled on C++.

The program consist of a few different parts. To represent the various
mathematical objects in the calculations, we created a collection of
classes of function called a \emph{byte tree}. These store group
elements and a few other types of data as specified in the
specification.

We wanted to keep the verifier as close to the specification in layout
as possible. Apart from some cryptographic primitives and the byte
trees, there is almost no code repetition in the verifier. This meant
that we would gain little to nothing by designing any kind of class
structure or abstractions.

The byte trees were modelled with a few classes representing nodes and
leaves. This enabled us to hide away complex operations behind simple
interfaces which resulted in a more readable and maintainable code
throughout the rest of the verifier.

\subsection{Tools}

We developed the program on two different platforms. The code was kept
in a git repository and hosted on GitHub. One of the development
platforms used OS X 10.8 with Emacs and g++ 4.7. The other used
Windows 8 with Visual Studio 2012. We generated reference documents
for the program with Doxygen.

\subsection{Third Party Libraries}

The verifier makes use of a few third party libraries. The actual
arithmetic in the byte tree nodes are done with the GMP arithmetic
library. This enables us to handle arbitrary large numbers which are
used in cryptography. We also use RapidXML for parsing the
protInfo.xml file at the very beginning of the verifier. For
cryptographic hash functions we use OpenSSL and finally for unit
testing we use Google's Google Test library.

\subsubsection{Arithmetic Library}

For the actual arithmetic done in the IntLeaf node class we use the
GNU Multi-Precision Library (GMP). On Windows this is replaced by the
library Multiple Precision Integers and Rationals (MPIR), a drop in
replacement which is easier to compile on windows systems. We chose
GMP because it is a well known, very stable and free library for
bignum operations.

\subsubsection{XML Parser}

RapidXML is used to parse the protInfo.xml file in the beginning of
the algorithm. Since this is a very simple operation and we only do
this once, we wanted a lightweight library to do the XML
parsing. RapidXML consists of a few header files and has an easy to
use interface.

\subsubsection{Cryptographic Primitives}

All of the PRGs and ROs in the verifier are implemented in the
verifier but at the core they all depend on cryptographic hash
functions such as the SHA-2 family. We take these functions from the
OpenSSL library. OpenSSL is a well known, stable and free library for
various cryptographic related functions.

\subsubsection{Testing}

To test the byte tree classes and our cryptographic functions we used
some unit testing. We used Google Test as our unit test framework
because it was simple and easy to use. The unit tests were invaluable
in tracking down subtle bugs in our byte tree implementation,
especially regarding memory management.

\subsection{Math Library - The Byte Tree}

To facilitate for the various calculation that needs to be done with
various mathematical objects. We created a collection of \emph{byte
  tree} classes. The classes use the GMP library internally to perform
the actual arithmetic calculations. The classes then wrap these
operations in a class hierarchy which enables us to create arrays and
trees and perform calculations with these compound structures. There
are also functions to import strings and files and convert them into
these classes. The classes can also be serialized into arrays and
strings which are used for testing and debugging purposes.

\subsection{Pseudorandom Generators and Random Oracles}

The specification also provide details on the PRG:s and RO:s used in
Verificatum. These primitives are implemented as classes which are
instantiated to perform their respective operations as described
earlier. These classes use hash functions from the OpenSSL library
internally to perform the hashing part.

\subsection{Verifier}

To keep track of some data which is persistent throughout the
execution, we created a structure to hold this data. This structure
was created at the beginning of the execution and then passed around
to the different algorithms.

Apart from the byte tree classes and the cryptographic primitives, we
needed a few helper functions. The purpose of these functions was to
check that some different byte tree adhered to a certain structure.

Each named algorithm in the specification was implemented as its own
function. The functions became long but since none of the code is
repeated and the possibilities for isolated testing was minimal, we
chose to not split up the algorithms into several functions.

\subsection{Testing and Debugging}

For the \emph{byte tree}, PRG and RO classes, a small collection of
unit tests were created. The tests for the PRG and RO classes were
taken from the test vectors chapter in the specification while the
byte tree tests were created by us. The tests were implemented with
the Google Test test framework.

When all the parts of the program had been implemented we received
test data from Wikström to verify that the program worked. The data
contained two small instance with all the input files required by a
normal run of the verifier. Additionally the test data contained the
correct state of key variables throughout important steps of the
execution. The debugging was done in Visual Studio. By stepping
through the program and comparing states against the test data we
removed bugs in the program.
