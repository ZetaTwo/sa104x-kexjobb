\section{Background}

Our work concerns the Verificatum mix-net, VMN, which is an
implementation of a cryptographic system called a mix network or
mix-net. Before describing VMN and mix-nets in general, we need to
learn about the basic building blocks of these compounds. First a
common public key cryptographic scheme, called the El Gamal
cryptosystem is defined. This scheme constitutes a very central part
of VMN. Later on, other cryptographic building blocks are defined. The
chapter is concluded by a description of a mix-net.
