\section{Background}

Our work concerns Verificatum which is an implementation of a cryptographic system called a mix-net. To describe Verificatum, we need to know what a mix-net is. Before describing how mix-nets work, we need to learn about the basic building blocks of these compounds. First a common public key cryptographic system, called the El Gamal cryptosystem (k√§lla) is defined. This constitutes a very central part of the mix-net. Later in this chapter other cryptographic building blocks are defined. The chapter is concluded by a description of a mix-net.
