\section{Background}

Our work concerns Verificatum which is an implementation of a
cryptographic system called a mix network or mix-net. Before
describing Verificatum and mix-nets in general, we need to learn about
the basic building blocks of these compounds. First a common public
key cryptographic scheme, called the El Gamal cryptosystem is
defined. This scheme constitutes a very central part of the
Verificatum mix-net. Later on other cryptographic building blocks are
defined. The chapter is concluded by a description of a mix-net.
