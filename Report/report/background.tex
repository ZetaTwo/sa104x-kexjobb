\section{Background}

Our work concerns Verificatum which is an implementation of a
cryptographic system called a mix network or mix-net. To describe
Verificatum, we need to know what a mix-net is. Before describing how
mix-nets work, we need to learn about the basic building blocks of
these compounds. First a common public key cryptographic scheme,
called the El Gamal cryptosystem (k√§lla) is defined. This scheme
constitutes a very central part of the Verificatum mix-net. Later in
this chapter other cryptographic building blocks are defined. The
chapter is concluded by a description of a mix-net.
