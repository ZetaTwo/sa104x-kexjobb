Cryptography is useful whenever two or more parties want to communicate confidentially with each other. Traditionally, public key cryptography, PKC, enabled two parties to talk directly to each other with confidentiality and integrity. A mix-net is a construction based on PKC which enables two parties to communicate with each other through a collection of nodes. Aside from the usual benefits of PKC you also get anonymity.

Mix-nets can be implemented in different ways. Our work concerns the Verificatum Mix-Net created by Douglas Wikstr√∂m. Specifically we have evaluated the implementation manual for a verifier for the Verificatum Mix-Net which purpose is to enable third parties to convince themselves that the mix-net has behaved correctly without revealing any new information.
