A mix-net is a cryptographic protocol based on public key cryptography
which enables untraceable communication through a collection of
nodes. One important application is electronic voting where it enables
the construction of systems which satisfies many voting security
requirements, including verifiability of correct
execution. Verificatum is an implementation of a mix-net by Douglas Wikstr√∂m.

This report concerns the implementation of a verifier and evaluation
of the implementation manual for the Verificatum mix-net. The purpose
of the document is to enable third parties to convince themselves that
the mix-net has behaved correctly without revealing any secret
information. This implementation is a simple version of the verifier
using the document and some test vectors generated by the
mix-net. While the document does contain all information there are
still some possibilities for further clarification in order to make it
comprehensible to a larger audience.
