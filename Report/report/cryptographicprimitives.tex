\subsection{Cryptographic Primitives}

Many cryptographic systems, including VMN, make use of some basic
functions, normally called cryptographic primitives. These primitives
are functions or objects which possess properties interesting in
cryptographic contexts. VMN uses hash functions, pseudo random
generators and random oracles, all of which are described in this
chapter.

\subsubsection{Hash functions}
In general, a hash function is an easily computable function that
takes an input from an arbitrarily large input space and map it to an
element, a hash, in a finite sized hash space \cite[p.~321]{hac}. As a
consequence of this, there will exist several inputs which map to the
same hash. Hash functions are used in many different areas of computer
science and there are many different kinds tailored to have the
properties desired for its particular application. A cryptographic
hash function is a hash function with two important properties. First,
the hashes are uniformly distributed in the hash space. Simply put,
this means that if you try to guess which hash a given input will
produce you will never have a significantly better chance than just
random guessing. Furthermore, for a cryptographic hash function all of
the following are infeasible.

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding an input which produces a given hash
\item Given an input and its hash, finding another input with the same hash
\item Finding two inputs which produce the same hash
\end{itemize}

In mix-nets any cryptographic hash function could be used. A common
choice is the SHA-2 family of hash functions, namely SHA-256, SHA-384
and SHA-512 \cite[p.~6]{wikstrom1}. Their main difference is the
number of bits they output, i.e. the size of the hash space which is
256, 384 and 512 respectively.

\subsubsection{Pseudo Random Generators}

A \emph{Pseudo Random Generator}, PRG, is a function which takes an
initial seed and expands it into a longer sequence of seemingly random
data, pseudo random data \cite[p.~170]{hac}. The output is random in
the sense that it should be indistinguishable, for any efficient
algorithm, from truly random output but the same seed will always
produce the same output.

VMN uses a PRG based on a cryptographic hash function that hashes the
seed together with a counter which increases for every iteration
\cite{wikstrom1}.

\subsubsection{Random Oracles}

In theory, a \emph{Random Oracle}, RO, is a black box which takes an
input and returns a truly random output from its output space
\cite{oracle}. It will always respond with the same output for the
same input. This is very similar to a hash function but has some
subtle differences. An RO is a purely theoretical construct which
defines no actual function, only a relationship between inputs and
outputs.

In practice though, within VMN a construct called an RO is used. This
construct is based on a cryptographic hash function and a seed. The
purpose of the seed is to permute the relationship between the inputs
and outputs of the hash function and thus creating an easily
randomizable RO without coming up with a whole new hash function
\cite{wikstrom1}.
