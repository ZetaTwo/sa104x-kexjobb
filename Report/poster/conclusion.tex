Using the cryptographic constructions of El Gamal cryptography it is
possible to create a scheme for electronic voting by using
mix-nets. From the use of zero-knowledge proofs the Verificatum
mix-net is a verifiably secure implementation. The need for
verification of correct execution is essential to the use of computers
in voting applications. It is therefore of great importance that the
documentation describing implementation of a verifier is correct and
accessible.

The specification document for the verifier includes all the
information required to write the verifier. However, the structure
could be improved for greater readability. The document could also
benefit from an improved overall description of the Verificatum
mix-net so that one easier can get a better understanding of what
approach to take when implementing the verifier.
