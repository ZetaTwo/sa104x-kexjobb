Using the properties of El Gamal cryptography it is possible to create
a scheme for electronic voting by using mix-nets. 

The Verificatum mix-net is a verifiably secure implementation. The
verifiability is achieved by using zero-knowledge proofs for correct
execution. The need for this sort of verification is essential to the use of
computers in voting applications. It is therefore of great importance
that the documentation describing implementation of a verifier is
correct and accessible.

The specification document for the verifier includes all the
information required to write the verifier. However, the structure
could be improved for greater readability. The document could also
benefit from an improved overall description of the Verificatum
mix-net so that one easier can get a better understanding of what
approach to take when implementing the verifier.
