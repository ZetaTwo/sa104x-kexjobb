Using the cryptographic constructions of El Gamal cryptography it is
possible to create a scheme for electronic voting by using
mix-nets. Verificatum has successfully [bla bla bla].
//

However, the need for verification of correct execution is essential
to the computers used in voting applications. It is therefore of great
importance that the documentation describing implementation of a
verifier is correct and accessible.

The specification document for the verifier includes all the
information required to write the verifier. However, the structure
could be improved for greater readability. Lastly, the document could
benefit from an improved overall description of the Verificatum
mix-net so that one easier can get a better understanding of what
approach to take when implementing the verifier.
