The verification of execution relies on a concept called
zero-knowledge proof. A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic
protocol that can be used by one party, the prover, to prove to
another party that some statement is true without revealing additional
information.

The verifier takes as input the ciphertexts, the output messages and the extra data, the zero-knowledge proofs, created by each mix-net server. It then performs a series of calculations which prove whether the mix-net was executed correctly or not and outputs this.
