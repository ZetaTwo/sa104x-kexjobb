A mix-net is a cryptographic protocol based on public key cryptography
which enables untraceable communication through a collection of
nodes. One important application is electronic voting where it enables
the construction of systems which satisfies many voting security
requirements, including verifiability of correct
execution. Verificatum is an implementation of a mix-net by Douglas
Wikstr√∂m.

Our work concerns the implementation of a verifier for the Verificatum
mix-net and evaluation of a document describing the
implementation. The purpose of the document is to enable third parties
to convince themselves that the mix-net has behaved correctly without
revealing any secret information. 

By implementing a verifier, the document is examined and feedback is
provided to its author. This is one step in making the document
correct and more accessible.
