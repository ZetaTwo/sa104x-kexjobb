One purpose of mix networks, or mixnets, is to provide untraceability
to its users. A mixnet may, for example, take as input a list of
encrypted messages of different origins. These messages pass through
the mixnet and is output decrypted and in a randomized order. This
property may be used to enable anonymous voting systems.

A reencryption mixnet consists of a number of servers which
sequentially process the messages and reencrypts the list of messages
and outputs them in a randomized order. After passing through all
servers, the list of ciphertexts is decrypted and the result is a list
of the messages in random order. It is impossible to deduce from where
each element came.
