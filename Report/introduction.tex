Why cryptography?

The area of Cryptography concerns the theory of secure communication.

Originally Cryptography was interchangeable with the encryption of

over an insecure channel.

Symmetric encryption

In 1976 Diffe and Hellman publiced the first paper on public key
cryptography. This was a new sort of cryptographic construction that
allowed --.
