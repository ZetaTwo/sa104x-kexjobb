The documentation describing the Verificatum Mixnet verifier---.

The document describes a number of subtasks, some of which may be
implemented independently. The subtasks include include implementation
of general representation of data, an arithmetic library needed to
perform group operations, the cryptographic primitives and the
structure of files created during an execution of the
mixnet. Furthermore, all algorithms executed during the verification
are described in detail in order to allow an independent verifier.

Here follows some suggestions to improve the readability and ---.
